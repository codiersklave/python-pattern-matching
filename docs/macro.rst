PyPatt Macro Implementation
===========================

.. warning::

   The macro implementation is not recommended for use in production.

Python, I love you. But I'd like you to change. It's not you, it's me. Really.
See, you don't have pattern matching. But, that's not the root of it. Macros are
the root of it. You don't have macros but that's OK. Right now, I want pattern
matching. I know you offer me ``if``/``elif``/``else`` statements but I need
more. I'm going to abuse your ``with`` statements. Guido, et al, I hope you can
forgive me. This will only hurt a little.

Presenting: PyPatt - pattern matching in Python with code transforms.

A lot of people have tried to make this work before. Somehow it didn't take. I
should probably call this yet-another-python-pattern-matching-module but
"yappmm" doesn't roll off the tongue. Other people have tried overloading
operators and changing codecs. This module started as a codec hack but those are
hard because they need an ecosystem of emacs-modes, vim-modes and the like to
really be convenient.

PyPatt takes a different approach. No import hooks, no codecs, no operator
overloads. Instead, I present a function decorator. Apply ``@pypatt.transform``
and you're off to the races. Let's take a look:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 3,9,10

   import pypatt

   @pypatt.transform
   def test_demo():
       values = [[1, 2, 3], ('a', 'b', 'c'), 'hello world',
           False, [4, 5, 6], (1, ['a', True, (0,)], 3)]

       for value in values:
           with match(value):
               with 'hello world':
                   print 'Match strings!'
               with False:
                   print 'Match booleans!'
               with [1, 2, 3]:
                   print 'Match lists!'
               with ('a', 'b', 'c'):
                   print 'Match tuples!'
               with [4, 5, quote(temp)]:
                   print 'Bind variables! temp =', temp
               with (1, ['a', True, quote(result)], 3):
                   print 'Nest expressions! result =', result

       print 'Wow, pretty great!'

Finally, pythonic pattern matching! If you've experienced the feature before in
"functional" languages like Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, F#, OCaml, etc. then you
can guess at the semantics. The syntax is an abuse of ``with`` statements. If it
were described in the standard docs, it would look like:

::

    match_stmt  ::= "with" "match" "(" expresssion ")" ["as" name] ":" match_suite
    match_suite ::= NEWLINE INDENT like_stmt+ DEDENT
    like_stmt   ::= "with" expression ":" NEWLINE INDENT suite DEDENT

Hopefully, you noticed the ``match`` and ``quote`` function calls. Those aren't
really function calls and you can change them as needed. ``match`` works by
identifying the ``with`` statement as a match-statement. It would be nice if
Python had a way to define your own types of statements but that's beyond the
scope of this project.

It might have read better if I'd used an ``if`` statement rather than
``with``. In that case you would read:

.. code-block:: python

    if match(expression):
        with True:
            print 'The expression is True.'
        with _:
            print 'The expression is not True.'

This has the benefit of sounding better: "if match expression with True ...".
But ``if`` statements don't support the ``as`` syntax. So if you put something
complex inside the ``match`` parens, you can't bind it to a name. You might
instead bind it to a name on the nested ``with`` statements but I'm doing all
this to save keystrokes so that works against the goal.

Now, regarding the ``quote`` function call (that is not really a function call
at all). You can only put the name of a variable within that call and if you do
so it won't be evaluated at runtime. Instead, it will be bound to its matching
value. Imagine it like you're quoting the variable name, but you don't want to
match a string. So to bind a variable you replace ``"my_variable"`` with
``quote(my_variable)``. The former would otherwise match the string
``my_variable``.

It would have been nice if Python supported custom string types for this
purpose. So far I'm aware of normal strings: ``"blah"``, raw strings:
``r"blah"``, unicode strings: ``u"blah"``, and byte strings: ``b"blah"``. When
developing this module, I wished I could create a new kind of ``quoted`` string
which might look like: ``q"blah"``. It's rare that I see a `C++ feature`_ and
look on with envy. This topic more commonly arises when people want a syntax for
stating an ``OrderedDict`` in an expression. Maybe ``OrderedDict{'foo': 20,
'bar': 45}`` is the future. Looks funny today.

Caveats
-------

- ``@pypatt.transform`` must be the inner-most decorator.
- Does not support lambda functions.
- Does not work on nested functions.
- Requires inspect.getsource to work.
- Only tested on CPython 2.6 and 2.7.

Examples
--------

- Type-pattern:

::

    import pypatt, math

    @pypatt.transform
    def area(shape):
        with match(type(shape)):
            with Triangle:
                return shape.base * shape.height * 0.5
            with Square:
                return shape.side ** 2
            with Rectangle:
                return shape.length * shape.width
            with Circle:
                return math.pi * shape.radius ** 2
            with _:
                raise Exception('unknown shape')

    @pypatt.transform
    def factorial(num):
        with match(num):
            with 1:
                return 1
            with _:
                return num * factorial(num - 1)

Future Work
-----------

- Support/test Python 2.6, Python 3 and PyPy 2 / 3
- Support ellipsis-like syntax to match anything in the rest of the list or
  tuple. Consider using ``quote(*args)`` to mean zero or more elements. Elements
  are bound to args:

::

    match [1, 2, 3, 4]:
        like [1, 2, quote(*args)]:
            print 'args == [3, 4]'

- Match ``set`` expression. Only allow one ``quote`` variable. If present the
  quoted variable must come last.

::

    with match({3, 1, 4, 2}):
        with {1, 2, 4, quote(value)}:
            print 'value == 3'
        with {3, 4, quote(*args)}:
            print 'args = {1, 2}'

- Add "when" clause like:

::

    with match(list_item):
        with like([first, second], first < second):
            print 'ascending'
        with like([first, second], first > second):
            print 'descending'

- Add ``or``/``and`` pattern-matching like:

::

    with match(value):
        with [alpha] or [alpha, beta]:
            pass
        with [1, _, _] and [_, _, 2]:
            pass

- Match ``dict`` expression?
- Match regexp?
- Provide more generic macro-expansion facilities. Consider if this module
  could instead be written as the following:

::

    def assign(var, value, _globals, _locals):
        exec '{var} = value'.format(var) in _globals, _locals

    @pypatt.macro
    def match(expr, statements):
        """with match(expr): ... expansion
        with match(value / 5):
            ... statements ...
        ->
        pypatt.store['temp0'] = value / 5
        try:
            ... statements ...
        except pypatt.PyPattBreak:
            pass
        """
        symbol[temp] = expand[expr]
        try:
            expand[statements]
        except pypatt.PyPattBreak:
            pass

    @pypatt.macro
    def like(expr, statements):
        """with like(expr): ... expansion
        with like(3 + value):
            ... statements ...
        ->
        pypatt.store['temp1'] = pypatt.bind(expr, pypatt.store['temp0'], globals(), locals())
        if pypatt.store['temp1']:
            for var in pypatt.store['temp1'][1]:
                assign(var, pypatt.store['temp1'][1][var], globals(), locals())
            ... statements ...
            raise pypatt.PyPattBreak
        """
        symbol[result] = pypatt.bind(expr, symbol[match.temp], globals(), locals())
        if symbol[result]:
            for var in symbol[result][1]:
                assign(var, symbol[result][1][var], globals(), locals())
            expand[statements]
            raise pypatt.PyPattBreak

    @pypatt.expand(match, like)
    def test():
        with match('hello' + ' world'):
            with like(1):
                print 'fail'
            with like(False):
                print 'fail'
            with like('hello world'):
                print 'succeed'
            with like(_):
                print 'fail'

I'm not convinced this is better. But it's interesting. I think you could do
nearly this in ``macropy`` if you were willing to organize your code for the
import hook to work.
